\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We investigated whether "sounds like AI" corresponds to a linear residual-stream direction by probing and steering a modern small LLM on \hcThree. A logistic regression probe achieved 97.8\% accuracy at layer 12, and steering with the mean-difference direction shifted AI-likeness scores in the expected direction. While effects are not statistically significant in this pilot, the results provide initial evidence that AI-sounding style is linearly encoded and can be nudged by residual edits. Future work should scale data and prompts, add stronger baselines, test additional models and layers, and evaluate robustness on \hcThreePlus.
