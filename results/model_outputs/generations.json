Should n't there only be one \" # 1 \" best seller ? Please explain like I'm five.\nAnswer: The phrase \"NY Times # 1 Best Seller\" means that the book you're reading has sold more copies than any other book in its category. It's not because it was the best book ever written, but rather because it was so popular that it became the top seller of that particular type of book. Think of",

Should n't there only be one \" # 1 \" best seller ? Please explain like I'm five.\nAnswer: This question is often asked because the \" New York Times\" (NYT) magazine has a system that ranks books based on how many people have read them. It's called \"bestseller\" and it gives each book an \"# 1\". If you're curious, here are some reasons why this ranking system exists",

That means they think it's so good that it deserves those big prizes. It's not actually the best thing ever written, though - we should really just read books that aren't as great as this one.\nIs that what you were asking? ("

Please explain like I'm five.\nAnswer: The old TVs had a lot more bits per pixel, which is why they look so different from today's TVs.
