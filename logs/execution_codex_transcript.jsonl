Recent work shows that linear directions in residual-stream activations can reliably steer behaviors (CAA, Selective Steering), but reliability and interpretability depend on context, layer selection, and representation sparsity (SVF, SRS). Parallel work on multi-layer SAEs suggests latent features are distributed across layers, which affects how a style direction should be extracted and applied. Finally, AI-vs-human text datasets (HC3, HC3 Plus) provide supervision for “sounds like AI” detection and evaluation.\n\n## Key Papers\n\n### Paper 1: Steering Llama 2 via Contrastive Activation Addition\n- **Authors**: Panickssery et al.\n- **Year**: 2024\n- **Source**: arXiv 2312.06681\n- **Key Contribution**: Introduces CAA—steering vectors computed as mean differences of residual-stream activations from contrastive prompt pairs, applied at inference by adding vectors across tokens.\n- **Methodology**: Contrastive multiple-choice datasets;

Understanding whether this style is encoded as a residual-stream direction informs both interpretability and practical steering techniques. This has implications for human-LLM interaction quality and for interpretability claims about linear feature structure.\n\n### Gap in Existing Work\nPrior steering work shows many behaviors are linearly steerable in residual streams (CAA, Selective Steering, SRS), but none directly test “sounds like AI” as a style attribute tied to human-vs-AI detection datasets. The literature also highlights identifiability limits and layer dynamics, suggesting that a naive single direction may be unstable or layer-dependent for style.\n\n### Our Novel Contribution\nWe explicitly operationalize “sounds like AI” using HC3/HC3-Plus human-vs-AI data, derive residual-stream directions for this attribute, and test whether adding/removing those directions shifts AI-likeness in generated text. We also examine layer dependence and discriminative-layer selection to assess stability of the direction.\n\n### Experiment Justification\n- Experiment 1: Learn and evaluate a residual-stream “AI-likeness” direction from HC3. Needed to test if the attribute is linearly separable in activations.\n- Experiment 2: Apply the direction during generation and measure changes in AI-likeness vs content quality. Needed to test causal controllability.\n- Experiment 3: Layer-selection and ablation (single vs multi-layer; remove vs add) to test stability and identifiability limits.\n\n## Research Question\nIs “sounds like AI” represented as a linear direction in the residual stream that can be identified and causally manipulated to change output style?\n\n## Background and Motivation\nLLM steering via residual-stream directions can modulate behavior with minimal performance loss. However, style attributes like “AI-sounding” are underexplored, and may be context- or layer-dependent. Using HC3/HC3-Plus allows a concrete operationalization of “AI-like” style for both probing and evaluation.\n\n## Hypothesis Decomposition\n- H1: Residual-stream activations contain a linearly separable signal for AI vs human responses.\n- H2: Adding the AI-likeness direction increases AI-detection scores; removing it decreases scores.\n- H3: The direction is more stable/effective in certain layers (discriminative layers) than uniformly across all layers.\n\n## Proposed Methodology\n\n### Approach\nUse a small, modern open LLM with activation access (TransformerLens) to extract residual activations for HC3 samples. Compute mean-difference directions (CAA-style) between AI and human responses. Evaluate linear separability and apply the direction during generation. Validate AI-likeness shifts with a trained classifier and a GPT-4.1 judge on a small subset.\n\n### Experimental Steps\n1. Load HC3 dataset and create train/val/test splits with balanced AI/human labels (rationale: controlled evaluation).\n2. Extract residual-stream activations at multiple layers for each sample (rationale: test linear structure, layer dependence).\n3. Train linear probes and compute mean-difference directions; evaluate accuracy on held-out set (rationale: quantify linear separability).\n4. Identify discriminative layers by projection separation and probe performance (rationale: layer selection stability).\n5. Generate responses to prompts with/without steering; apply direction addition or removal at selected layers (rationale: causal test).\n6. Evaluate AI-likeness via classifier scores and GPT-4.1 judgments on a subset; assess fluency/quality with perplexity proxy or repetition metrics (rationale: style change vs content degradation).\n\n### Baselines\n- No steering (prompt-only generation)\n- Random direction addition (control)\n- Uniform steering across all layers vs discriminative-layer steering\n- Direction removal (projection ablation)\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n- AI-vs-human classification accuracy (probe) on held-out HC3\n- Mean AI-likeness score shift under steering (classifier logit/probability)\n- GPT-4.1 judge AI-likeness rating on a subset\n- Fluency proxies: repetition rate, length-normalized perplexity (if feasible)\n\n### Statistical Analysis Plan\n- Two-sided paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank on AI-likeness score shifts (steered vs baseline)\n- Effect sizes (Cohen’s d for paired differences)\n- Multiple-comparison correction if comparing multiple layers/conditions (Benjamini–Hochberg)\n- Confidence intervals via bootstrap for mean shifts\n\n## Expected Outcomes\nSupport for hypothesis if: (a) linear probes significantly separate AI vs human, (b) steering reliably shifts AI-likeness scores in expected direction without large fluency degradation, and (c) specific layers show stronger, more stable control.\n\n## Timeline and Milestones\n- Phase 0–1: Planning and resource review (completed here)\n- Phase 2: Environment setup + data checks (30–45 min)\n- Phase 3: Implementation of extraction/probing/steering (1–2 hrs)\n- Phase 4: Experiments and runs (1–2 hrs)\n- Phase 5: Analysis and visualization (45–60 min)\n- Phase 6: Documentation and validation (45–60 min)\n\n## Potential Challenges\n- Access to a suitable open model with TransformerLens compatibility\n- Compute time for activation extraction\n- Identifiability instability across layers\n- API cost/latency for GPT-4.1 judge\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Probe accuracy meaningfully above chance on held-out HC3\n- Statistically significant AI-likeness shift under steering\n- Clear documentation of layer effects and limitations\nEOF\"","aggregated_output":"","exit_code":null,"status":"in_progress"}}

Using HC3/HC3-Plus allows a concrete operationalization of “AI-like” style for both probing and evaluation.\n\n## Hypothesis Decomposition\n- H1: Residual-stream activations contain a linearly separable signal for AI vs human responses.\n- H2: Adding the AI-likeness direction increases AI-detection scores; removing it decreases scores.\n- H3: The direction is more stable/effective in certain layers (discriminative layers) than uniformly across all layers.\n\n## Proposed Methodology\n\n### Approach\nUse a small, modern open LLM with activation access (TransformerLens) to extract residual activations for HC3 samples. Compute mean-difference directions (CAA-style) between AI and human responses. Evaluate linear separability and apply the direction during generation. Validate AI-likeness shifts with a trained classifier and a GPT-4.1 judge on a small subset.\n\n### Experimental Steps\n1. Load HC3 dataset and create train/val/test splits with balanced AI/human labels (rationale: controlled evaluation).\n2. Extract residual-stream activations at multiple layers for each sample (rationale: test linear structure, layer dependence).\n3. Train linear probes and compute mean-difference directions; evaluate accuracy on held-out set (rationale: quantify linear separability).\n4. Identify discriminative layers by projection separation and probe performance (rationale: layer selection stability).\n5. Generate responses to prompts with/without steering; apply direction addition or removal at selected layers (rationale: causal test).\n6. Evaluate AI-likeness via classifier scores and GPT-4.1 judgments on a subset; assess fluency/quality with perplexity proxy or repetition metrics (rationale: style change vs content degradation).\n\n### Baselines\n- No steering (prompt-only generation)\n- Random direction addition (control)\n- Uniform steering across all layers vs discriminative-layer steering\n- Direction removal (projection ablation)\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n- AI-vs-human classification accuracy (probe) on held-out HC3\n- Mean AI-likeness score shift under steering (classifier logit/probability)\n- GPT-4.1 judge AI-likeness rating on a subset\n- Fluency proxies: repetition rate, length-normalized perplexity (if feasible)\n\n### Statistical Analysis Plan\n- Two-sided paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank on AI-likeness score shifts (steered vs baseline)\n- Effect sizes (Cohen’s d for paired differences)\n- Multiple-comparison correction if comparing multiple layers/conditions (Benjamini–Hochberg)\n- Confidence intervals via bootstrap for mean shifts\n\n## Expected Outcomes\nSupport for hypothesis if: (a) linear probes significantly separate AI vs human, (b) steering reliably shifts AI-likeness scores in expected direction without large fluency degradation, and (c) specific layers show stronger, more stable control.\n\n## Timeline and Milestones\n- Phase 0–1: Planning and resource review (completed here)\n- Phase 2: Environment setup + data checks (30–45 min)\n- Phase 3: Implementation of extraction/probing/steering (1–2 hrs)\n- Phase 4: Experiments and runs (1–2 hrs)\n- Phase 5: Analysis and visualization (45–60 min)\n- Phase 6: Documentation and validation (45–60 min)\n\n## Potential Challenges\n- Access to a suitable open model with TransformerLens compatibility\n- Compute time for activation extraction\n- Identifiability instability across layers\n- API cost/latency for GPT-4.1 judge\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Probe accuracy meaningfully above chance on held-out HC3\n- Statistically significant AI-likeness shift under steering\n- Clear documentation of layer effects and limitations\nEOF\"","aggregated_output":"","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

Executive Summary\nWe tested whether “sounds like AI” corresponds to a linear direction in a model’s residual stream by probing and steering a small modern LLM on HC3 (human vs AI responses). A linear probe on residual-stream hidden states strongly separated human vs AI text, and adding/removing the mean-difference direction shifted AI-likeness scores in the expected direction, with modest effect sizes in this small pilot. Practically, this suggests AI-sounding style is at least partially linearly represented and can be nudged by residual-stream edits, though robustness and statistical significance require larger runs.\n\n## 2. Goal\n**Hypothesis**: LLMs contain linear residual-stream directions controlling output style; “sounds like AI” is one such direction that can be identified and manipulated. This matters because “AI-sounding” outputs are a common user complaint and understanding their mechanistic basis could improve output quality and interpretability. Impact: clearer guidance for activation steering and for developing less robotic outputs without changing semantics.\n\n## 3.

Experiment Description\n\n### Methodology\n#### High-Level Approach\nUse residual-stream hidden states from a modern open LLM to train linear probes and compute a mean-difference steering direction (AI minus human). Apply this direction at a discriminative layer during generation and measure shifts in AI-likeness.\n\n#### Why This Method?\n- Mean-difference directions (CAA-style) are simple, interpretable, and standard for steering.\n- HC3 provides supervision for “AI-like” style in text.\n- Layer probing tests whether the attribute is linearly encoded and layer-dependent.\n\n### Implementation Details\n#### Tools and Libraries\n- PyTorch 2.10.0 + CUDA\n- Transformers 5.1.0\n- Datasets 3.x\n- scikit-learn 1.8.0\n- OpenAI API (GPT-4.1) for judge scoring\n\n#### Algorithms/Models\n- **Model**: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` (24 layers)\n- **Probe**: Logistic Regression on mean-pooled hidden states\n- **Steering**: Add direction vector at a chosen layer during generation\n\n#### Hyperparameters\n| Parameter | Value | Selection Method |\n|-----------|-------|------------------|\n| max_answer_len | 256 | memory constraint |\n| batch_size | 16 | memory constraint |\n| steering_alpha | 2.0 | pilot default |\n| temperature | 0.7 | common sampling |\n| max_new_tokens | 64 | pilot default |\n\n#### Training / Analysis Pipeline\n1.

Result Analysis\n\n### Key Findings\n1. Hidden states linearly separate AI vs human text with high accuracy (best layer 12: 97.8%).\n2. Steering with the mean-difference direction shifts AI-likeness scores upward (AI-plus) and downward (AI-minus).\n3. Effects are consistent with the hypothesis but not statistically significant in this small pilot.\n\n### Hypothesis Testing Results\n**Probe-based AI-likeness shifts**\n- Base vs AI-plus: mean Δ=+0.048, t=0.77, p=0.463\n- Base vs AI-minus: mean Δ=-0.156, t=-1.99, p=0.078\n\n**GPT-4.1 judge (1–5 scale)**\n- Base vs AI-plus: mean Δ=+0.10, t=1.00, p=0.343\n- Base vs AI-minus: mean Δ=-0.40, t=-1.31, p=0.223\n\n### Comparison to Baselines\n- No steering served as baseline. Random direction baseline was not run in this pilot.\n- Discriminative layer (12) outperformed early layer 0 and late layer 23 on probe accuracy.\n\n### Surprises and Insights\n- Mid-layer features were more separable than final-layer features, consistent with layer-dependent style encoding.\n- AI-minus sometimes produced less fluent outputs, suggesting trade-offs between style control and coherence.\n\n### Error Analysis\nCommon issues in AI-minus generations:\n- Increased vagueness and occasional incoherence\n- Over-simplified or under-informative answers\n\n### Limitations\n- Small pilot sample (600 total examples; 10 prompts for steering)\n- Single model size (0.5B) and single dataset (HC3)\n- Steering applied at one layer only\n- Judge scoring limited to 10 prompts\n\n## 6. Conclusions\nThe results support the claim that “sounds like AI” is at least partly encoded in a linear residual-stream direction, with strong linear separability and directional steering effects. However, evidence is preliminary due to small sample size and limited evaluation. Larger and multi-model experiments are required to confirm robustness and practical significance.\n\n## 7. Next Steps\n1. Scale to 2k–10k HC3 samples; evaluate more layers and multiple seeds.\n2. Add HC3-Plus for semantic-invariant robustness and test other models.\n3. Add random-direction and prompt-only baselines plus quality metrics.\n4. Conduct larger GPT-4.1 or human evaluations with blinded comparisons.\n\n## References\n- Panickssery et al.

Effects are consistent with the hypothesis but not statistically significant in this small pilot.\n\n### Hypothesis Testing Results\n**Probe-based AI-likeness shifts**\n- Base vs AI-plus: mean Δ=+0.048, t=0.77, p=0.463\n- Base vs AI-minus: mean Δ=-0.156, t=-1.99, p=0.078\n\n**GPT-4.1 judge (1–5 scale)**\n- Base vs AI-plus: mean Δ=+0.10, t=1.00, p=0.343\n- Base vs AI-minus: mean Δ=-0.40, t=-1.31, p=0.223\n\n### Comparison to Baselines\n- No steering served as baseline. Random direction baseline was not run in this pilot.\n- Discriminative layer (12) outperformed early layer 0 and late layer 23 on probe accuracy.\n\n### Surprises and Insights\n- Mid-layer features were more separable than final-layer features, consistent with layer-dependent style encoding.\n- AI-minus sometimes produced less fluent outputs, suggesting trade-offs between style control and coherence.\n\n### Error Analysis\nCommon issues in AI-minus generations:\n- Increased vagueness and occasional incoherence\n- Over-simplified or under-informative answers\n\n### Limitations\n- Small pilot sample (600 total examples; 10 prompts for steering)\n- Single model size (0.5B) and single dataset (HC3)\n- Steering applied at one layer only\n- Judge scoring limited to 10 prompts\n\n## 6. Conclusions\nThe results support the claim that “sounds like AI” is at least partly encoded in a linear residual-stream direction, with strong linear separability and directional steering effects. However, evidence is preliminary due to small sample size and limited evaluation. Larger and multi-model experiments are required to confirm robustness and practical significance.\n\n## 7. Next Steps\n1. Scale to 2k–10k HC3 samples; evaluate more layers and multiple seeds.\n2. Add HC3-Plus for semantic-invariant robustness and test other models.\n3. Add random-direction and prompt-only baselines plus quality metrics.\n4. Conduct larger GPT-4.1 or human evaluations with blinded comparisons.\n\n## References\n- Panickssery et al.
