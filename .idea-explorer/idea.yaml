idea:
  title: Is there a 'sounds like AI' direction in the residual stream?
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'Large language models exhibit linear structure in their residual streams
    that controls output style and semantics; this research asks whether "sounding
    like an AI" is one such direction that can be identified and manipulated.

    '
  background:
    description: LLMs are known to have a lot of linear structure that controls their
      output styles and semantics. Is sounding like an AI one of those?
